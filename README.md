## Copying

You may use, edit, and redistribute any of these files (with exception to the items in the credits above), and I don't want credit. I only ask that you try to link me to any improvements you make, so I can impliment them. Thank you.


## Bugs

There are more bugs in this theme than in a Detroit apartment building. Nonetheless, if you find them, squish them or tell me about them. I may or may not be interested in fixing them, as this is just a personal project, so don't be offended if I'm not up for it.
